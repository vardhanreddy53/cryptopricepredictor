# cryptopricepredictor
A B.Tech mini project that predicts the next-day prices of cryptocurrencies using machine learning and technical trade indicators. Built with a Flask web application and integrated with real-time APIs for an end-to-end automated solution.

📌 Project Objective
Predict the next-day price of major cryptocurrencies using ML techniques.

Evaluate whether cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can act as publicly traded commodities.

Analyze if cryptocurrencies can replace fiat currencies (e.g., USD) for transactions and economic control.

Provide a user-friendly application with features like price visualization, future price prediction, and real-time alerts.
